## Notes

- Juxtaposition of audio and visual content is a device commonly used to create cognitive dissonance, asking the viewer to view the content more closely.
- While it is possible to attempt to represent the difference in audio and visual content presented in the video, it is ultimately an imperfect analog to its effect on screen.
- As such, I've selected to transcribe primarily audio content, and include visual content where it is critical to the meaning of the video.
